This project is a continuation of the amazing Blueboy Portal Project for Classic World of Warcraft. This project is NOT meant to be hosted publicly as it removes some security restrictions surrounding bots. Namely that any player logged in to the server can summon a bot from any account. The purpose of this project is to provide a Single Player experience in World of Warcraft where you can do PVE activities such as raids and dungeons with intelligents bots.

The short term goal for this project is to provide "Boss Strategies" where you can assign your bots raid/group roles and groups that affect how act in a given encounter. Right now this is still conceptual and more details will be provided as things progress.

The following are some changes/enhancements that were made to this project.

- You can have as many bots as you want across as many accounts as you want, the limit to only using bots from the account you are logged in to has been lifted from previous Portal versions.

- Bots will automatically accept a guild invite if you are the guild master

- Upon login, all bots that are on your guild will automatically be logged in when you log in to the game.

- All bots currently logged in will level up with you and automatically gain new skills and all level appropriate spells. Bots will also randomly learn professions and level those up as well.

- Bots will only be summoned to you if they are on you party.

More features will be implemented as time goes on.
